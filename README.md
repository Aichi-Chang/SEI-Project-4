# General Assembly, Software Engineering Immersive


### 🚩 Project-4 - Workbench ###
#### Working with UX designer

The final project of the software engineering immersive course at GA London. The assignment was to create a **full-stack application** in within **one week**.

Workbench is a schedule management app aimed at designers or students managing their on-going projects. Different users will have a clean board to themselves to start with and they will be able to add and update notes or to-do lists. The platform enables users to track their work flow online.

### :rocket: Get Started ###

* Clone or download the repo

* `npm install` and `pipenv install` to install dependencies
* `python manage.py dumpdata project4 --output todos/fixtures.json --indent=2` to populate database
* `npm run serve:backend` to run back end
* `npm run serve:frontend` to run front end


### 📝 Brief ###

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own back end and front end
* **Use a Python Django API** using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Have a visually impressive design**
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.
